# UI Client Strings
Strings for our translators

This repository holds all the string files for the app and the base Admin string files.  Parts of the admin files, those with formatting, should probably not be edited here since they may not load properly.  That mainly concerns the top boxes in admin.

See issues for more notes concerning specific loads here.

## For Translation

## Translated

   These are then copied to top level folder which is current set of language files.
